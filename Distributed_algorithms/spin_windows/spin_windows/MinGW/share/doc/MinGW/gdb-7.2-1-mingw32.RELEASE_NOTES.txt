gdb
========================================================================
GDB, the GNU Project debugger, allows you to see what is going on `inside'
another program while it executes -- or what another program was doing at the
moment it crashed.

Release:  gdb-7.2-1-mingw32

Files:    gdb-7.2-1-mingw32-src.tar.lzma     (full source code)
          gdb-7.2-1-mingw32-doc.tar.lzma     (documentation)
          gdb-7.2-1-mingw32-bin.tar.lzma     (binary programs)

Build requirements: gcc >= 3, gnu make, coreutils, sed, mktemp, python (optional)

Runtime requirements: python (optional)

Notes:    Two versions of the gdb binary are available in this release:

          gdb           console
          gdb-python27  console, with Python support

          The python enabled gdb requires that you install the official Python
          2.7 distribution available from:

          http://python.org/download/

          To build gdb with python support you need to copy libpython27.a to
          libpython2.7.a and copy include files to include/python2.7:

          cp /python/libs/libpython27.a /python/libs/libpython2.7.a
          mkdir /python/include/python2.7
          cp /python/include /python/include/python2.7
          mkdir build
          cd build
          ../gdb-7.2/configure --host=mingw32 --target=mingw32 \
            --build=mingw32 CFLAGS="-s -L/python/libs -I/python/include" \
            --with-python
